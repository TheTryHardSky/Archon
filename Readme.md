# Archon Playground

This repository contains experimental Python code used for Archon quality assurance
exercises. The `archon_core` package demonstrates a fully fledged yet lightweight task
orchestration service featuring a command line interface, structured configuration,
secure token issuance, and comprehensive unit tests.

Refer to `archon_core/README.md` for usage instructions.
